## Description


my motivation for this app was learning how to make an app that multiple users can interact on. Being able to see peoples posts and working with logins and signups and making them save between site usage. 
I think building this project was good practice for potentially making something for a business or freelance work 
I learned about logins and their info which I think was really important for my development as a web developer.


## installation
